      ¡Hola! I am a particle physicist working at the [Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration](https://cmsexperiment.web.cern.ch/collaboration) (CMS) at [CERN](https://home.cern) since 2017 and I'm interested in fundamental particles and their interactions. In specific, I'm working on searches with unconventional signatures, like the ones produced by long-lived particles, triggers, and in the development of the Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) of the [MIP timing detector](https://cms.cern/news/new-precision-timing-detector-cms-hl-lhc-upgrade) (MTD) that will be implemented for the CMS High Luminosity LHC upgrade.
    </p>

      I did my PhD at [Instituto de Física de Cantabria](https://ifca.unican.es/) (IFCA) and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) (2023–present).
