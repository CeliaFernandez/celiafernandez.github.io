      Hola! I am a particle physicist working at the <a href="https://cmsexperiment.web.cern.ch/collaboration" target="_blank">Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration</a> (CMS) at <a href="https://home.cern" target="_blank">CERN</a> since 2017. I'm interested in fundamental particles and their interactions. I'm currently working on searches for unconventional signatures, such as those produced by long-lived particles, on trigger development, and on the design of the Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) for the <a href="https://cms.cern/news/new-precision-timing-detector-cms-hl-lhc-upgrade" target="_blank">MIP Timing Detector</a> (MTD), which will be implemented as part of the CMS High-Luminosity LHC upgrade.

I did my PhD at [Instituto de Física de Cantabria IFCA](https://ifca.unican.es/) (2018-2023) and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) (2023–present).
